# QEMU_TMPDIR is the ramdisk used for accelerating qemu
# this version is for running headless
# make sure you add 'console=ttyS0,9600' to your grub, and start a getty on
# ttyS0

# How to use QEMU under screen:
# 1) Install your operating system using a normal QEMU session, making sure to
# enable serial console everywhere (bootloader, kernel boot, inittab)
# 2) start screen.  a .screenrc profile with commonly run programs is optional
# 3) inside of screen, start QEMU.  use tbe below script as an example.  Make
# sure you use -nographic at the minimum, that will cause all output to go to
# the faux serial port
# 4) once the OS is up and running, log in
# 5) to give screen commands, use the double Ctrl-A sequence:
# ^a^aw will show you a list of open windows in screen
# 6) screen can take control of the ^a sequence, in which case the double
# Ctrl-A will stop working; in that case, use the screen ^a sequence first 
# (Ctrl-a a), then send the QEMU command after that

# QEMU console mode commands
# ^a ^a - send Ctrl-a to a program (including screen?)
# ^a x - exit the emulator
# ^a s - save snapshot data to disk
# ^a b - send magic sysrq (break key)
# ^a c - switch between console and monitor

# set a pidfile
PIDFILE=/home/virtual/etch-kernelbuild/qemu.pid

# if you get errors when starting QEMU about 'kqemu' not being found, re-insert
# the kqemu kernel module: /sbin/modprobe kqemu major=250
# also make sure that /dev/kqemu is writeable by the same user that's running
# qemu
